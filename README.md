# Vertical-Billboard
A vertical billboard shader for unity. Useful for grass or name tags.
Objects will ignore their transform's rotation and face towards the camera while keeping the top of the object pointing upwards(only rotating on yaw).

Scaling can be done by scaling the transform of the object
